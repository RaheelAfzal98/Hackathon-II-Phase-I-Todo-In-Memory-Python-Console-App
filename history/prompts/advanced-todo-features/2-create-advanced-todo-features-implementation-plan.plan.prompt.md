# Prompt History Record: Create Advanced Todo Features Implementation Plan

## User Input

```
Advanced Level Implementation Plan – Phase I CLI Todo Application

Project Context:
This plan follows the approved `/sp.specify` for Advanced Level features of
"The Evolution of Todo – Phase I".
All Basic and Intermediate Level features are already implemented and must not
be modified or refactored.

Objective:
Define a clear, step-by-step implementation plan for adding intelligent,
time-aware behavior to the existing in-memory CLI Todo application using
Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.

Scope:
This plan applies ONLY to Advanced Level features:
- Recurring Tasks
- Due Dates & Time Reminders

No Basic or Intermediate feature changes are allowed.

Planning Principles:
- Manual coding is strictly prohibited
- All source code must be generated by Claude Code
- Each step must map directly to the approved Advanced Level specification
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Avoid introducing background services or external dependencies

- Ensure CLI output displays:
  - Due date and time
  - Overdue indicators
  - Recurrence information
- Maintain consistency with existing CLI command structure

Step 6: Integration & Validation
- Verify Advanced features integrate cleanly with:
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Intermediate search, filter, and sort
- Confirm no behavior regressions
- Validate edge cases:
  - Completing recurring tasks
  - Viewing overdue tasks
  - Running the CLI across different times

Step 7: Documentation Updates
- Update README.md:
  - Document Advanced Level CLI usage
- Ensure specs folder contains:
  - Advanced Level specification file
- Confirm CLAUDE.md still enforces:
  - Spec-first development
  - No manual coding

---

Deliverables:
- Enhanced Todo model with recurrence and due-date support
- Service-layer logic for intelligent task behavior
- CLI support for recurring tasks and reminders
- Stable integration with existing features
- All changes traceable to the Advanced Level specification

Success Criteria:
- Recurring tasks auto-reschedule correctly
- Due dates and overdue tasks behave as specified
- Time reminders trigger safely within CLI constraints
- No Basic or Intermediate functionality is broken
- Implementation can be completed solely via Claude Code
```

## Response Summary

Completed the implementation plan for Advanced Todo Features with:

1. **Technical Context**: Defined Python 3.13, standard library only, in-memory storage, CLI application constraints

2. **Constitution Check**: Verified all constitution requirements are satisfied including manual coding prohibition, spec-first development, and agentic workflow

3. **Project Structure**: Planned to extend existing architecture with enhanced models, services, and CLI layers

4. **Phase 0 Research**: Created research.md documenting technical approaches for recurring tasks, due dates, and time reminders

5. **Phase 1 Design**:
   - Created data-model.md with enhanced Todo entity including due_date, recurrence fields
   - Created contracts/todo-contract.md with API definitions for advanced features
   - Created quickstart.md with implementation guidance
   - Updated agent context with new technology stack

All planning artifacts created and ready for the next phase (/sp.tasks).
