# Prompt History Record: Create Advanced Todo Features Specification

## User Input

```
Advanced Level Features for Phase I – CLI Todo Application

Project Context:
"The Evolution of Todo – Phase I" is an in-memory, CLI-based Todo application
built using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.
Basic and Intermediate Level features are already implemented and must remain
unchanged.
This specification defines ONLY the Advanced Level features.

Target Audience:
Hackathon participants acting as Product Architects using AI-assisted,
spec-driven development.

Objective:
Introduce intelligent and time-aware behavior into the CLI Todo application
while keeping the system in-memory and non-distributed.

Scope:
This specification applies ONLY to Advanced Level features.
No new Basic or Intermediate features may be introduced or modified.

Mandatory Advanced Features:

1. Recurring Tasks
- The system must support recurring todo items.
- Supported recurrence patterns must include:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Custom interval (in days)
- A recurring task must automatically generate the next occurrence
  after completion.
- Recurrence configuration must be:
  - Optional at task creation
  - Editable for existing tasks
- Recurring behavior must not duplicate tasks incorrectly or infinitely.

2. Due Dates & Time Reminders
- Each todo item may have an optional due date and time.
- The system must:
  - Track overdue tasks
  - Clearly indicate overdue status in CLI output
- Time reminders must:
  - Trigger notifications at or before the due time
  - Operate within CLI/runtime constraints
  - Not require external services or background daemons
- Reminder behavior must be non-blocking and safe for CLI execution.

Advanced Behavior Rules:
- Recurring tasks must respect due dates when present
- Completion of a recurring task must:
  - Mark the current task complete
  - Schedule the next occurrence automatically
- Overdue recurring tasks must not skip occurrences silently

Non-Functional Requirements:
- In-memory data only
- No file or database persistence
- No external scheduling libraries or system cron usage
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Models define recurrence and due-date metadata
  - Services handle scheduling and reminder logic
  - CLI displays status and user feedback

Constraints:
- Manual coding is prohibited
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- All behavior must originate from this specification
- No web, GUI, or distributed features allowed
- No background threads that outlive the CLI process

Success Criteria:
- Users can create and update recurring tasks via CLI
- Recurring tasks automatically reschedule upon completion
- Users can assign due dates and times
- Overdue tasks are clearly identified
- Time reminders trigger safely during CLI execution
- Existing Basic and Intermediate features continue to work without change
- Specification is sufficient for Claude Code to implement without assumptions
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the Advanced Todo Features including:

1. **User Scenarios & Testing**:
   - Created 5 prioritized user stories covering recurring tasks, due dates, and reminder functionality
   - Defined acceptance scenarios for each user story
   - Identified key edge cases

2. **Functional Requirements**:
   - 16 detailed functional requirements covering all aspects of recurring tasks and due dates
   - Requirements ensure system behavior matches specified constraints

3. **Key Entities**:
   - Defined RecurringTask, DueDate, and TaskReminder entities

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - 7 measurable outcomes to validate implementation

5. **Quality Checklist**:
   - Created validation checklist confirming specification completeness

The specification is ready for the next phase of development.
