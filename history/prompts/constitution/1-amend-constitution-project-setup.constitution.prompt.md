## Prompt

# The Evolution of Todo
## Phase I – In-Memory CLI Todo Application
### sp.Constitution (All-in-One)

---

## 1. Project Title

**The Evolution of Todo**
**Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application**

---

## 2. Project Overview

This project simulates the real-world evolution of software systems. In Phase I, the goal is to design and build a **simple in-memory command-line Todo application** using **spec-driven development** and **AI-assisted coding**.

Students act as **Product Architects**, focusing on architecture, specifications, and development process rather than writing manual code. The project starts with a basic CLI script and is designed to evolve in later phases into a **distributed, cloud-native, AI-powered system**.

---

## 3. Project Goal

- Teach software evolution through incremental complexity
- Enforce **spec-first development**
- Use AI as the primary implementation engine
- Eliminate boilerplate and manual coding
- Evaluate students on thinking, planning, and iteration quality

---

## 4. Development Philosophy

- Manual code writing is **strictly prohibited**
- All development must follow the **Agentic Dev Stack workflow**:
  1. Write Specification
  2. Generate Plan
  3. Break into Tasks
  4. Implement via Claude Code
- **Claude Code** is the only entity allowed to generate or modify source code
- **Spec-Kit Plus** is the single source of truth
- Process quality is more important than feature count

---

## 5. Target Audience

- Students
- Hackathon participants
- Product architects in training
- Developers learning AI-driven development

---

## 6. Technology Stack

- Python **3.13+**
- **UV** package manager
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- In-memory data storage
- Tools:
  - Spec-Kit Plus
  - Claude Code

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Core Features)

The application **must implement all five basic Todo features**:

### 7.1 Add Task
- Create a new todo item
- Required fields:
  - Title
  - Description

### 7.2 View Task List
- Display all todo items
- Each task must show:
  - Unique ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Completion status (Complete / Incomplete)

### 7.3 Update Task
- Modify an existing task using its ID
- Editable fields:
  - Title
  - Description

### 7.4 Delete Task
- Remove a task permanently using its ID

### 7.5 Mark Task as Complete
- Toggle task status:
  - Complete
  - Incomplete

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- Clean, modular, and maintainable architecture
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Data models
  - Business logic / services
  - CLI interface
- Readable and idiomatic Python code (generated by Claude Code)
- Graceful error handling
- No premature optimization or unused features

---

## 9. Data Constraints

- All data must be stored **in memory only**
- No file system persistence
- No databases
- Data is lost when the application exits

---

## 10. Required Project Structure

The GitHub repository **must follow this exact structure**:


/
├── Constitution.md
├── specs/
│ ├── spec-1.md
│ ├── spec-2.md
│ ├── spec-3.md
│ └── ...
├── src/
│ └── todo/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── main.py # CLI entry point
│ ├── models.py # Todo data models
│ ├── services.py # Business logic
│ └── cli.py # CLI interaction layer (optional)
├── README.md
├── CLAUDE.md
└── pyproject.toml




---

## 11. Structure Explanation

### Root Level
- **Constitution.md**
  Defines the rules, philosophy, and constraints of the project.

- **specs/**
  Contains the full, versioned history of all specification iterations generated using Spec-Kit Plus.

- **pyproject.toml**
  UV and Python project configuration.

---

### src/todo/
- **main.py**
  Application entry point for the CLI Todo app.

- **models.py**
  Defines Todo data structures and entities.

- **services.py**
  Contains core business logic for managing todos.

- **cli.py (optional)**
  Handles user input/output and command routing.

---

### Documentation Files
- **README.md**
  Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide.

- **CLAUDE.md**
  Instructions and constraints for Claude Code, including:
  - No manual coding
  - Architecture rules
  - Spec-first enforcement

---

## 12. Quality & Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on:

- Strict adherence to spec-driven development
- Clarity and completeness of specifications
- Correct usage of Spec-Kit Plus commands
- Logical task decomposition
- Transparent iteration history
- Correct implementation of all five Todo features
- Clean architecture and readable code

---

## 13. Out of Scope (Phase I)

The following are **explicitly excluded**:

- File or database persistence
- Web or GUI interfaces
- Authentication or user management
- Multi-user or networked features
- Advanced enhancements beyond core Todo operations

---

## 14. Definition of Done (Success Criteria)

The project is considered **complete** when:

- A fully functional in-memory CLI Todo app is delivered
- All five core features work correctly
- All specs
```

## Core Principles

### Spec-First Development
All development must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: 1. Write Specification, 2. Generate Plan, 3. Break into Tasks, 4. Implement via Claude Code

### AI-Assisted Coding
Claude Code is the only entity allowed to generate or modify source code; Manual code writing is strictly prohibited

### Spec-Driven Development
Spec-Kit Plus is the single source of truth; Process quality is more important than feature count

### Clean Architecture
Clear separation of concerns: Data models, Business logic/services, CLI interface; Clean, modular, and maintainable architecture

### In-Memory Constraint
All data must be stored in memory only; No file system persistence; No databases; Data is lost when the application exits

### Functional Completeness
Must implement all five basic Todo features: Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark Task as Complete

## Technology Stack Requirements

Python 3.13+, UV package manager, Command Line Interface (CLI), In-memory data storage, Tools: Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code

## Development Workflow

Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write Specification → Generate Plan → Break into Tasks → Implement via Claude Code

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation and approval; All development must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow; Manual code writing is strictly prohibited

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-31 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-31
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution file with project-specific principles and governance
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with spec generation for the todo app
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now properly reflects the todo app project requirements and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin spec generation for the todo app
