# Implementation Plan: Advanced Todo Features

**Branch**: `001-advanced-todo-features` | **Date**: 2026-01-03 | **Spec**: [Advanced Todo Features Spec](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-advanced-todo-features/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of Advanced Level features for the CLI Todo application, focusing on recurring tasks with daily, weekly, and custom interval patterns, and due dates with time reminder functionality. The system will maintain in-memory storage while ensuring clean separation of concerns between models, services, and CLI layers. The implementation will follow the existing architecture patterns while adding intelligent, time-aware behavior to the application.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (datetime, uuid, dataclasses)
**Storage**: In-memory only (N/A - no persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI application
**Project Type**: Single project CLI application
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all operations
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, in-memory only, no background processes
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user CLI application, up to 10,000 tasks in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Manual coding forbidden - All code will be generated by Claude Code
- ✅ Spec-first development - Following approved specification
- ✅ Agentic Dev Stack workflow - Following /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → Claude Code
- ✅ All feature levels completed in sequence - Building on existing Basic and Intermediate features
- ✅ No feature without spec - Following approved Advanced features spec
- ✅ Architecture separation - Maintaining models/services/CLI layer separation
- ✅ In-memory only - Complying with data constraints
- ✅ No external scheduling libraries - Implementing time logic within CLI constraints

*Post-design verification: All constitution requirements continue to be satisfied with the planned implementation approach.*

│   └── main.py          # CLI entry point with advanced commands
```

**Structure Decision**: Using the existing single project structure with enhanced models, services, and CLI layers. The implementation will extend the existing files rather than creating new ones to maintain consistency with the existing architecture.
